INSTALLATION
============

The following packages are required to compile mythchanger in an Ubuntu/mythbuntu 
environment:

 * build-essential
 * libraw1394-dev
 * libiec61883-dev
 * libavc1394-dev

You can install these packages with Synaptic, or via apt-get.

If compiling in a different environment, you will need to ensure the necessary build 
packages and development libraries are installed.

To compile, from inside the mythchanger directory, do:

   $ make clean
   $ make
   $ sudo make install

The changer executable "mythchanger" will be installed to /usr/bin

USING mythchanger
=================

The command syntax for mythchanger is:

 $ mythchanger -c <channel> [OPTION]...

Mandatory arguments: channel number

 Options:
    
    -c <channel number> channel to tune
    -f <changer> force channel changer:
        1 = SA3250HD
        2 = SA4200HD (and some 3250s)
        3 = SA4250HDC
        4 = SA4250HDC alternate (and 4240HDCs with 4250 firmware)
        5 = SA8300
        6 = Motorola Fast (DCH and DCT series)
        7 = Motorola alternate
     -g <GUID> GUID of target STB
     -h display this help and exit
     -P power on STB (default: no)
     -R reset firewire bus before doing anything else (default: no)
     -v verbose output
     -V Display version information and exit

OPTION OVERVIEW
===============

-c <channel number>         The channel you want to tune

-f <changer>                If your STB is detected incorrectly or if the channel changer
                            mythchanger selects does not work, you can force the use of another
                            changer with this option.

-g <GUID>                   Changes channel of the STB with the supplied GUID.  This is very
                            useful for backends with multiple firewire tuners.  Otherwise, the 
                            default action is to change the channel on the first STB found on
                            the firewire bus.

-h                          Displays help info and exits

-P                          Power on the STB before channel change- default: no.  Use this option
                            if you or MythTV routinely powers down your STB.  Also useful to recover
                            after firmware update on SA STBs, which power off after update.

-R                          Performs a bus reset BEFORE doing anything else.  Use only if *absolutely*
                            necessary for unstable STBs.
                            
-v                          Verbose output- will display *everything* mythchanger is doing, to help
                            with troubleshooting and debugging.
                            
-V                          Displays version number and exits
