INSTALLATION
============

The following packages are required to compile mythprime in an Ubuntu/mythbuntu 
environment:

 * build-essential
 * libraw1394-dev
 * libiec61883-dev
 * libavc1394-dev

You can install these packages with Synaptic, or via apt-get.

If compiling in a different environment, you will need to ensure the necessary build 
packages and development libraries are installed.

To compile, from inside the mythprime directory, do:

   $ make clean
   $ make
   $ sudo make install

The primer executable "mythprime" will be installed to /usr/bin

GENERAL INFO
=================

mythprime is a utility to "prime" firewire connections to cable Set-Top-Boxes (STBS),
in order to stabilize the connection for recording with mythtv.

It attempts to intelligently identify the connected STB(s), pick the correct method
of priming (p2p or broadcast) and selects the appropriate channel changer to use-
(if required).  It will make multiple attemps, with success or errors reported and
can be run in verbose mode (-v) from the command line for troubleshooting bad or
troublesome connetions.

USING mythprime
=================

*** It is *highly recommended* to test and prime with the MythTV backend server stopped ***

to stop the backend:

 $ sudo /etc/init.d/mythtv-backend stop

Replace "stop" with "start" in the preceding command to restart the backend when
you are finished with any command-line testing.

The command syntax for mythprime is:

 $ mythprime [OPTION]...

Mandatory arguments: none

 Options:
    
    -c <channel number> tune to safe <channel> before priming
    -f <changer> force channel changer:
        1 = SA3250HD
        2 = SA4200HD (and some 3250s)
        3 = SA4250HDC
        4 = SA4250HDC alternate (and 4240HDCs with 4250 firmware)
        5 = SA8300
        6 = Motorola Fast (DCH and DCT series)
        7 = Motorola alternate
     -h display this help and exit
     -P power on STB (default: no)
     -R reset firewire bus before doing anything else (default: no)
     -v verbose output
     -V Display version information and exit

OPTION OVERVIEW
===============

-c <channel number>         Tune this channel number before attempting to prime.  This is
                            useful in helping assure you get a good prime the first time,
                            by tuning the STB to a known-unencrypted and prime-able channel.

-f <changer>                If your STB is detected incorrectly or if the channel changer
                            mythprime selects does not work, you can force the use of another
                            changer with this option.

-h                          Displays help info and exits

-P                          Power on the STB before priming- default: no.  Use this option if
                            you or MythTV routinely powers down your STB.

-R                          Performs a bus reset BEFORE doing anything else.  This option is
                            useful for some STBs that jump to a new node on the first bus reset.
                            Setting this option should ensure that the STB will jump to, and
                            (hopefully) remain on, the same node during the entire session.  It
                            is also a useful option for very unstable STBs like like the firewire
                            bus reset before connections are made.
                            
-v                          Verbose output- will display *everything* mythprime is doing, to help
                            with troubleshooting and debugging.
                            
-V                          Displays version number and exits
              

Most users should have good success running mythprime without any options.  

Should you need to add additional options, e.g.: -P or -R, etc., then you 
will need to add them to the mythprime launch command in:

/etc/init.d/mythtv-backend

(remember to edit it as sudo)
