mythbrake.sh
============

This is a userjob wrapper to Handbrake-CLI.   Its intened uses is to be run as /usr/local/bin/mythbrake with arguments via mythtv user job.  This is still rather rough but meets my needs, will be improved upon as time permits.  Issues can be created as "mythbrake - TITLE OF MY ISSUE"
